Hi, I'm Michael Erasmus. My pronouns are he/him.

I currently work for [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) as the Director of Data Science and Analytics. DonorsChoose is an amazing non-profit org with the mission to make it easy for anyone to help a teacher in need, moving us closer to a nation where students in every community have the tools and experiences they need for a great education.

Before DonorsChoose, I worked at [Buffer](https://buffer.com/).

The list of things that make me happy

- Work
- Reading and learning for the sake of it
- Writing
- Traveling
- Surfing and swimming
- Cooking
- Playing Ukulele
- My Family

I write about adventures in Data Science & Engineering, Machine Learning, SQL, Python and other things!

I live in beautiful Santa Cruz, CA
