            "content": "Welcome to my new blog, modelxy! This has been a long time coming, the last time I&#39;ve blogged was around 2017 and I can&#39;t believe all that time has gone by without me sharing much to the world. . Well that stops today. I&#39;m resolved to get back into the swing of things. I might be a little rusty and need some practice, but I have a lot to say and a lot to share, so here goes! . One of the big reasons I&#39;ve been hesitant to start writing on a blog has been the friction around sharing code easily. I really like being able to understand and explain concepts through the lens of writing code. Using most blog engines makes for a sub-optimal solution of running code somewhere else and then copy-pasting it into formatted code snippets. I much rather prefer mixing code and prose like I can do in a Jupyter Notebook. . Thus this blog is powered by Fastpages, and as much as possible I&#39;ll be writing posts as notebooks. . In fact, this post was written as a Notebook! To prove it, here is an rendering of the Sierpiński triangle made using the Chaos Game Method1. . . Adapted from this example&#8617; . | import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10), dpi=80) image_size = np.array((1000, 1000)) r, nsides, npts = 0.5, 3, 500000 # The vertices of a regular polygon with nsides sides and a vertex pointing up, # calculated on the unit circle centered at (1,1) polygon = [(np.cos(phi)+1, np.sin(phi)+1) for phi in np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 2.*np.pi/nsides)] # Map vertices to image pixels pts = (np.array(polygon) * 0.5 * (image_size-1)) # Initial point at centre of polygon p1 = np.array(image_size/2) aimg = np.zeros(image_size) # Play the Chaos Game! for i in range(npts): irow = np.random.randint(nsides) p2 = pts[irow] p1 = (p1 * r + p2 * (1-r)) aimg[tuple(p1.astype(int))] += 1 plt.pcolor(aimg) plt.show() . Isn&#39;t that quite beautiful? When I first learned about fractals I was deeply struck by how such complex structure can emerge from very simple building blocks. When using a process such as the chaos game to construct our fractal, it&#39;s incredible that order can emerge from chaos. . These are the lessons I take when it comes to my humble new blog. My hope is that over time some each nugget of information I can share can build up to a greater whole. I plan to write about a diverse set of topics, whatever I find to be intellectually interesting. My wish is that some kind of order can emerge from this chaos. . The world is full of beautiful ideas and this blog is a celebration of all that beauty. Let&#39;s have fun exploring together! .",
